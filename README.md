# Super-Resolution_Structured_Illumination_Microscopy
This repository contains the files and code for the University of St Andrews Module ID5220 - Medical Imaging and Sensing - Practical 3: Imaging Using Structured Light. The main aim of this practical is to demonstrate an understanding of 2D Super-Resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM). The project produced and tested a simple as well as an advanced SR-SIM algorithm.
